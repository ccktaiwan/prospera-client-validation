Client Validation Repository
Authority Boundary

Authority Boundary Statement:
This repository is a validation and audit repository used to verify adoption and compliance with Prospera OS Governance. It does not define governance authority, system rules, or execution constraints. All canonical governance and execution definitions reside exclusively in the prospera-os repository.

Repository Purpose

This repository exists to validate whether a client project repository has correctly adopted and complied with Prospera OS Governance.

It is used to assess governance alignment, authority boundaries, AI usage compliance, and traceability of execution artifacts.

This repository does not introduce execution logic, governance rules, or enforcement mechanisms.

Validation Scope

This repository may be used to validate:

Proper adoption of Prospera OS Governance

Presence and correctness of governance adoption declarations

Clear authority ownership and responsibility assignment

Compliance with AI participation boundaries

Traceability of AI-assisted and human-executed activities

Adherence to escalation and review requirements

Validation focuses on evidence and alignment, not implementation output quality.
