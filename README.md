Authority Boundary

This repository is a validation and audit repository used to assess adoption and compliance with Prospera OS governance.

It does not define governance authority, system rules, execution constraints, or enforcement logic. All canonical governance, execution definitions, and authority boundaries are defined exclusively by Prospera OS.

No content in this repository may redefine, override, or reinterpret Prospera OS authority.

Repository Purpose

This repository exists to validate whether client project repositories have correctly adopted and complied with Prospera OS governance.

It is used to assess governance alignment, authority boundaries, AI usage compliance, and traceability of execution artifacts.

This repository does not introduce execution logic, governance rules, enforcement mechanisms, or decision authority.

Validation Scope

Validation activities may assess proper adoption of Prospera OS governance, presence and correctness of governance adoption declarations, clarity of authority ownership and responsibility assignment, compliance with AI participation boundaries, traceability of AI-assisted and human-executed activities, and adherence to escalation and review requirements.

Validation focuses on evidence and alignment, not implementation output quality or business performance.

Explicit Exclusions

This repository must not define or modify governance rules, act as a governance authority, introduce enforcement tooling, replace human accountability with automated checks, or certify legal, regulatory, or business compliance.

This repository supports governance validation only.

Validation Methodology

Validation activities may include review of governance adoption declarations, inspection of repository structure and documentation, sampling of AI-assisted artifacts for traceability and approval, verification of human responsibility attribution, and identification of governance gaps or violations.

Validation findings are advisory in nature and must be reviewed and acted upon by responsible human authorities.

Relationship to Client Repositories

This repository is designed to operate against client project repositories derived from the Prospera OS Client Repository Template.

It does not modify client repositories.

Validation findings may result in remediation recommendations, governance escalation, artifact invalidation, or adoption confirmation, depending on governance review outcomes.

Governance Compliance

All validation activities are subject to Prospera OS governance.

Validation artifacts must remain traceable and evidence-based.

Authority for decisions remains with designated human roles.

In cases of uncertainty, ambiguity, or conflict, governance escalation is mandatory.
