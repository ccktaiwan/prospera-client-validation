# Prospera OS Governance Validation Overview

## Purpose

This repository serves as the **authoritative governance validation layer**
for projects claiming adoption of **Prospera OS Governance**.

It does **not** define governance rules, execution logic, or implementation patterns.

Its sole purpose is to **evaluate, validate, and adjudicate** whether a client
repository correctly adheres to Prospera OS governance principles.

## What This Repository Is

This repository is:

- A **governance validation authority**
- A **boundary enforcement reference**
- A **human-authoritative adjudication layer**

It exists to answer one question only:

> _Is a given client repository legitimately operating under Prospera OS governance?_

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository is **not**:

- A client project template
- A governance rule source
- An execution framework
- An automated compliance tool
- A CI / pass-fail enforcement engine

No governance rules are authored here.  
No authority is delegated to automation.  
No validation result is final without human review.

---

## Validation Model

Governance validation under Prospera OS follows these principles:

- **Governance is declarative, not executable**
- **Authority is explicit, not inferred**
- **Validation is review-based, not automatic**
- **Final judgment is always human-authoritative**

Automation may assist analysis, but **cannot grant governance legitimacy**.
