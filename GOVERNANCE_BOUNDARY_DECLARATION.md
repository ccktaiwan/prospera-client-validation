# Governance Boundary Declaration

## Purpose

This document formally defines the **governance boundaries** of the
Prospera OS validation repository.

It exists to prevent scope creep, authority overreach,
and implicit redefinition of governance rules.

---

## Validation Authority Scope

This repository is authorized to:

- Evaluate client repositories against declared Prospera OS governance principles
- Detect and document governance violations
- Issue validation results (PASS / FAIL)
- Publish adjudication records as immutable artifacts

---

## Explicit Non-Authority

This repository is **NOT authorized** to:

- Define, modify, or extend Prospera OS governance rules
- Act as an execution framework or policy engine
- Approve exceptions, waivers, or special cases
- Self-validate its own governance legitimacy

All governance rules and authority definitions are maintained externally.

---

## Human Authority Requirement

- All final governance judgments are **human-authoritative**
- AI systems may assist in analysis only
- No automated approval, override, or escalation is permitted

---

## Immutability Principle

- Published validation results are final
- Subsequent changes require a new validation version
- Historical adjudications MUST remain unchanged

---

## Boundary Enforcement

Any attempt to exceed the authority defined in this document
constitutes a governance violation.
